This is a multiplayer (currently going for 2-player) game where players compete against each 
other to collect items around a warehouse and bring them back to their individual spawns. Players
are also racing against time, so once time is up, whoever has the most points wins the game. This 
means syncing various objects and variables across the server (host) and clients. 

With a name like Junk Wars, it's gotta have a goofy style. We're attempting to do this with low-poly
characters and simple prefabs. If we finish the basic idea, we'd like to expand into more PvP aspects
to sabotage one another since players are in the same environment (a warehouse with loads of rooms).
Actions like pushing/grappling/stunning players, locking doors to prevent easy paths, and pits to reset any
player that falls in would all add to the competitive aspect.
